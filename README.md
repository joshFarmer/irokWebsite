# irok Foundation Website
A website that was designed and developed for a nonprofit organization that helps Indiana families with a certain blood disorder. HTML, CSS, flexbox, and JavaScript plugins were used to develop the website. This was a project for a web design course and while the organization I was developing the site for is in fact real, the project was more to show the foundation what a potential website for them could look like. 

Ultimately the design was not used as the foundation determined that most of their traffic was through their Facebook page, so there was no need to pay for a domain when it would bring in such a small level of traffic.
